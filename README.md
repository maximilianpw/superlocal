# Superlocal

Desktop-focused email, backed by a provider-agnostic Inbox SDK. Bring your mailboxes into one unified inbox while keeping their identities, credentials, and provider capabilities separate.

## Run locally

Requires **Bun 1.4+**.

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   bun --no-env-file install
   ```
2. Start the app:
   ```sh
    bun --no-env-file run start
   ```
3. Open **http://localhost:5178**.

The first run starts two fictional mailboxes through the real Inbox SDK. No provider credentials, OAuth setup, OpenCan, or machine-specific services are needed. **Ctrl-C stops both the client and local host.**

`start` builds and serves the optimized client locally. Use `bun --no-env-file run dev` for hot-reloading development; development-mode React diagnostics add overhead on large mailboxes. Both commands keep the same local-only host, sessions, and provider configuration.

## Docker with persistent storage

Run `docker compose up -d --build --wait`, then open **http://localhost:5178**.
The image contains the built app, not your configuration or mail. On first run,
the app creates a fictional installation in the named volume **`superlocal-state`**:

```text
/persist/superlocal.local.json
/persist/data/mock/             # Fictional mail, databases and generated keys
/persist/data/real/             # Created when real mode is selected
```

Each mode keeps `host.sqlite`, its mail database(s), `runtime-secrets.json` and
SQLite journals together. Configure real providers in the retained config as
described below; **never replace its instance ID or keys during an update**.
Google OAuth client secrets can be supplied through the same explicit environment
variables used locally. They are runtime inputs, not image build arguments.

After updating the checkout, run `docker compose up -d --build --wait` again.
Compose replaces the app container and reattaches the same volume. A hosting
platform's Git-triggered redeploy must likewise retain this volume at `/persist`;
the GitHub workflow below publishes images but does not restart a remote host.
`docker compose down` retains the volume; **do not use `down -v` or delete the
volume when updating**. Back up config, databases and keys together with the app
stopped. Existing Mac installations are not imported automatically.

Set `SUPERLOCAL_DOCKER_PORT` to use another local port and `SUPERLOCAL_VOLUME_NAME`
only for a deliberately separate installation. Do not run two app instances on
the same volume. Named volumes are initialized for the image's non-root `bun`
user; a bind-mount replacement must be owned by that user's UID/GID (1000:1000),
with private directories and `0600` config/key files.

Only the web port is published, on host loopback. The backend stays inside the
container. Browser-local settings
and recovery copies remain in the browser; this volume preserves server state.

### Published images

Pushes to `main` build and publish **Linux AMD64 and ARM64** images at
`ghcr.io/r44vc0rp/superlocal:latest`. The workflow can also be run manually on
`main`. It uses GitHub's built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` with package-write permission;
no Docker Hub account or registry password is needed. Images also receive a
`sha-<full-commit-sha>` tag, and the workflow records the digest for pinned deploys.

To run or update the published image without building it locally:

```sh
SUPERLOCAL_IMAGE=ghcr.io/r44vc0rp/superlocal:latest \
  docker compose up -d --no-build --pull always --wait
```

The same `superlocal-state` volume is retained. Set `SUPERLOCAL_IMAGE` to a
commit-specific tag or digest to select a particular version; database migrations
may still limit downgrades. Other container hosts can use the same image and mount
`/persist` without Compose. Server restarts/webhooks remain host-specific.

GHCR packages initially default to private, even for a public repository. The
package owner must set its visibility to public once for anonymous pulls. A
private package instead requires a GitHub token with `read:packages` on the
deployment host. This workflow never includes runtime mail, keys or config in
the image.

### Restricted Google access

Google is the application login provider for restricted installations. It reuses
the same Google OAuth client ID and secret configured for Gmail, even when the
Gmail mailbox provider is disabled. Existing local/demo installations retain
their explicit `loopback` mode; adding Google credentials alone does not change
their access policy.

To enable the gate, set these runtime values (or set `auth.method`,
`auth.allowedEmails` and `web.origin` in the retained configuration):

```sh
SUPERLOCAL_AUTH_METHOD=google
SUPERLOCAL_AUTH_ALLOWED_EMAILS=you@example.com,teammate@example.com
SUPERLOCAL_WEB_ORIGIN=https://mail.example.com
SUPERLOCAL_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-web-client-id
SUPERLOCAL_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-web-client-secret
```

For a real remote mailbox setup, also select `mode: "real"` and enable the desired
providers in the retained config, as described under **Connect real providers**.
Mock mode remains an offline demo, not a connection to real mail services.

Register **both** redirect URIs on that Google OAuth web client:

```text
https://mail.example.com/api/auth/callback/google      # Application login
https://mail.example.com/v1/oauth/google/callback     # Optional Gmail connection
```

Application login requests only identity/profile scopes and checks Google's
verified email against the exact allowlist. An empty list denies everyone;
wildcards and whole-domain entries are not supported. Case and surrounding
whitespace normalize, but plus tags and Gmail dots are not rewritten. Restart
after changing the list: removed users' existing sessions then fail the access
check. Sign out is available in the sidebar footer.

**Each approved person has a private account on the installation.** Their first
Google sign-in starts with no connected mailboxes. They can connect multiple
mailboxes across the enabled providers; connections, mail, drafts and settings
are scoped to that person. There are no shared-mailbox or team roles. Google
login does not connect Gmail or grant mailbox scopes. Login provider tokens are
not retained after identity verification, and mailbox credentials stay in the SDK.

Browser-held preferences, draft recovery and issue reports are also user-scoped.
Switching the signed-in person loads a fresh application context; stale tabs and
requests cannot operate under the next person's session. Existing unscoped local
browser data and legacy loopback mail are not imported or exposed to Google
users. Configure a fresh remote installation and reconnect the desired providers;
this feature does not migrate an existing local installation.

Better Auth stores login identities, durable private-owner bindings and sessions
in `auth.sqlite` beside the mode's other databases. Its secret is derived from the
retained runtime session key, so `/persist` also preserves login state and user
ownership across redeploys. Missing Google
credentials fail closed in Google mode; it never falls back to local access.
Only the login shell/assets, auth flow and health check are public. Mail,
settings, attachments, authenticated images and event streams require an
approved session. Use HTTPS for a public origin; `loopback` mode still rejects
public origins and production startup. TLS/reverse-proxy setup remains external.
Login starts share a conservative installation-wide limit of 20 per minute;
forwarded client-IP headers are not trusted. For public exposure, apply per-client
limits at the trusted reverse proxy so one caller cannot exhaust that shared
budget. Removing an email denies its existing sessions while it is off the list;
re-adding it can restore those sessions until their absolute expiry or sign-out.

## One inbox, separate mailboxes

- **Unified by default.** Every added mailbox joins the unified view. Choose a smaller selection in **Settings → Mailboxes** when you want one.
- **Keyboard-first navigation.** **Ctrl+0** opens Unified inbox; **Ctrl+1–9** open your ordered pinned mailboxes.
- **Many mailboxes, one view.** Search and bulk-select provider mailboxes instead of creating hundreds of permanent tabs. Adding views triggers one initial sync per source, not one per domain.
- **Source-aware actions.** Overlapping views share one canonical message. Replies retain the correct sender; Done and snooze remain local mailbox workflows rather than upstream labels.
- **Isolated email rendering.** Received HTML stays in a script-disabled iframe. The SDK sanitizes content and serves eligible remote media through authenticated routes; image settings and known-tracker blocking remain authoritative.

## Providers and roadmap

The goal is **ready-to-connect providers out of the box**: choose a service, complete its authorization, and select mailboxes in the same UI. You will still need the provider account, required permissions, and any domain/DNS setup that service requires.

| Provider | Current state | Direction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mock mailboxes | Included and offline | Keep the full app usable immediately, without personal credentials. |
| Gmail | Implemented; host OAuth client configuration required | Make authorization, reconnects, and multi-account setup simpler. |
| [Inbound.new](https://inbound.new) | Implemented; API-key onboarding and domain/address views | Improve large-domain onboarding, import progress, and recovery within the provider's sync limits. |
| iCloud / IMAP | In progress | Email + app-specific-password setup for iCloud, secure IMAP/SMTP presets, and end-to-end provider qualification. |
| Fastmail | Built-in IMAP/SMTP preset; live account qualification pending | One connection per login, including incoming mail for custom-domain aliases. |
| [Resend](https://resend.com/docs/dashboard/receiving/introduction) | Planned | Add a sending/receiving adapter using received-email APIs, attachment retrieval, and verified webhook ingestion. |
| [Cloudflare Email Service](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-service/) | Planned | Bridge Email Routing / Email Workers into durable SDK mail storage, and integrate supported sending APIs or SMTP. |

Resend and Cloudflare support email workflows, but that does not automatically give them traditional IMAP folders or native read flags. Their adapters should expose real capabilities while the SDK supplies reusable local workflows.

### What we are working toward

1. **Less setup outside the app.** Provider presets, guided authorization, connection checks, and useful reconnect errors instead of routine configuration-file editing.
2. **More interchangeable providers.** Finish IMAP/iCloud support, then add Resend and Cloudflare without introducing separate frontend mail APIs.
3. **Better large-inbox progress.** Keep cached mail usable while imports run, show meaningful progress and partial failures, and extend paging as mailbox collections grow.
4. **Personalized Important / Other.** Add optional per-user learning from explicit corrections, with reversible feedback and conservative handling of uncertain mail.

## Architecture

```text
Client → Inbox SDK APIs → provider adapters
```

| Package | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `apps/web` | React client: inbox views, reading, composing, and settings. |
| `apps/local-host` | Application sessions, provider onboarding, runtime paths, and connection policy. |
| `packages/inbox-sdk` | Normalized mail contracts, SQLite storage, encrypted credentials, queries, jobs, drafts, events, and provider translation. |
| `apps/mock-api` | A fictional upstream and real `InboxProvider` implementation, not a fake SDK HTTP layer. |

The SDK currently runs on Bun and SQLite. The host supports explicit local-only sessions or allowlisted Google sign-in with private per-user mailboxes and settings. Shared-mailbox and team roles are not implemented.

## Connect real providers

The current Gmail and Inbound connectors use the local host configuration:

1. Stop the app and open the generated, git-ignored `superlocal.local.json`.
2. Set `mode` to `real` and enable `providers.gmail.enabled` and/or `providers.inbound.enabled`.
3. For Gmail, configure the host's Google OAuth web client. Register **`http://localhost:5178/v1/oauth/google/callback`** for the default local setup. Google does not accept `.local` redirect domains; use the configured localhost origin for local authorization.
4. Restart the app and open **Settings → Add Accounts**. Inbound takes an API key, then offers discovered mailboxes. Gmail uses the host-managed OAuth flow.
5. Use **Settings → Mailboxes** to choose unified inclusion and pinned shortcuts.

Provider credentials are submitted to the host, encrypted per connection by the SDK, and not returned by the mail APIs. Mock and real modes stay separate. The Gmail OAuth defaults reference `SUPERLOCAL_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `SUPERLOCAL_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`; export them explicitly, or configure the corresponding `providers.gmail.oauth` values as private strings or `{ "env": "YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME" }` references. No SDK `.env` file or unrelated ambient credentials are imported.

Real connections default to normal mail access (`allowProviderWrites.real: true`). For an optional read-only host, set it to `false`; Gmail can use `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly` with `openid` and `email` rather than modify/send scopes. Reauthorize old read-only grants before sending or modifying mail. Provider capabilities and OAuth permissions still determine which native actions are available.

### Fastmail

1. In the retained `superlocal.local.json`, set `mode` to `real` and ensure `providers.imap.enabled` is `true` (the default). Keep existing instance IDs, data and keys.
2. Restart, then open **Settings → Accounts → iCloud Mail / Fastmail / IMAP** and choose **Fastmail** under **Mail service**.
3. Enter your full Fastmail login email, not an alias, and a dedicated [app password](https://www.fastmail.help/hc/en-us/articles/360058752854) with Mail access. Your Fastmail plan must include IMAP. Never put passwords in source files or chat.
4. Connect once per login, even when several custom domains deliver into that mailbox. No DNS changes are needed. Reading mail for aliases is supported through the same mailbox; automatic alias discovery and a sender-identity picker are not part of this preset.

The host fixes IMAP to `imap.fastmail.com:993` and SMTP to `smtp.fastmail.com:465`, both with TLS. Superlocal saves a Sent copy via IMAP; if enabled, turn off Fastmail's **Save a copy when sending through third-party email clients** option under the advanced composing preferences in **Settings → My email addresses** to avoid duplicates. To replace an app password, choose **Reconnect** and select **Fastmail** again, using the same login.

The new built-in uses `builtin:fastmail`, outside the allowed custom-preset ID syntax. Existing custom presets named `fastmail` retain their endpoints, usernames, Sent policy and connection identity; no renaming or migration is needed. Reconnect requires selecting the original mail service. After a failed attempt, **Try again** retains the connection and service selection but clears the password.

<details>
<summary>Runtime storage and advanced local configuration</summary>

Keep the generated `instanceId` with its data. Runtime databases, encryption keys, and session keys live **outside the checkout**:

| Platform | Default location |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/superlocal/<instanceId>/` |
| Linux | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/superlocal/<instanceId>/`, defaulting to `~/.local/share` |
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%/superlocal/<instanceId>/` |

`dataDir` can point to another private directory. Back up the whole instance together: missing or mismatched keys fail closed and are never silently regenerated. Old pilot databases and `.env.local` credentials are not imported automatically.

The launcher serves the client on port **5178** and the SDK host on **8790**. `web.port`, `backend.port`, `web.origin`, and `web.allowedOrigins` control the local addresses. A null `web.origin` uses `http://localhost:<web.port>`. An existing OpenCan setup can expose `https://super.local`; Superlocal does not install or manage OpenCan.

For an isolated run, set `SUPERLOCAL_CONFIG` to a new configuration path and `SUPERLOCAL_DATA_DIR` to a separate private directory. The configuration's parent directory must exist. `SUPERLOCAL_WEB_PORT`, `SUPERLOCAL_API_PORT`, and `SUPERLOCAL_WEB_ORIGIN` override addresses. `bun --no-env-file run dev:host` starts only the backend.

## Development

From the repository root:

```sh
bun --no-env-file run test:web
INBOX_TEST_LIVE=false bun --no-env-file run test:api
bun --no-env-file run typecheck
bun --no-env-file run build
```

Live-provider qualification is separate from deterministic tests. Never commit credentials, private configuration, runtime databases, real mail, or private diagnostic captures.
